# Reinforcement-learning-project-
In this section, I explore reinforcement learning, implementing greedy, DQN, PPO version 0, and attempting to implement the new version of PPO from scratch. I also work with stable baselines and Gym environments.
I also implement reinforcement learning for stock market analysis.
